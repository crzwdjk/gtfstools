Potential ideas for future tools:
* Interline finder (to enhance FTN extractor)
* Transfer cluster finder
* Network graph
* System mapper (and FTN mapper)
* Schematic mapper
* Takt optimizer (to optimize transfers)
* Something to join up multiple GTFS datasets from different agencies
* Web timetables
* Network explorer (relies on timetables, mapping)
